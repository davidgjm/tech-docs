== Postmortem Review

== Review criteria
- Was key incident data collected for posterity?
- Are the impact assessments complete?
- Was the root cause sufficiently deep?
- Is the action plan appropriate and are resulting bug fixes at appropriate priority?
- Did we share the outcome with relevant stakeholders?

== Introducing Postmortem Culture

We reinforce a collabo‐ rative postmortem culture through senior management’s active participation in the review and collaboration process. Management can encourage this culture, but blameless postmortems are ideally the product of engineer self-motivation.
