== Cgroups
Docker also makes use of kernel control groups for resource allocation and isolation. A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources. Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints.

Docker Engine uses the following cgroups:

* *Memory cgroup* for managing accounting, limits and notifications.
* *HugeTBL cgroup* for accounting usage of huge pages by process group.
* *CPU group* for managing user / system CPU time and usage.
* *CPUSet cgroup* for binding a group to specific CPU. Useful for real time applications and NUMA systems with localized memory per CPU.
* *BlkIO cgroup* for measuring & limiting amount of blckIO by group.
* *net_cls* and *net_prio* cgroup for tagging the traffic control.
* *Devices cgroup* for reading / writing access devices.
* *Freezer cgroup* for freezing a group. Useful for cluster batch scheduling, process migration and debugging without affecting prtrace.

== Union File Systems

Union file systems operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker Engine uses UnionFS to provide the building blocks for containers. Docker Engine can use multiple UnionFS variants, including AUFS, btrfs, vfs, and devicemapper.

== Container Format

Docker Engine combines the namespaces, control groups and UnionFS into a wrapper called a container format. The default container format is _libcontainer_.

== Security

Docker Engine makes use of AppArmor, Seccomp, Capabilities kernel features for security purposes.

* *AppArmor* allows to restrict programs capabilities with per-program profiles.
* *Seccomp* used for filtering syscalls issued by a program.
* *Capabilties* for performing permission checks.
