A multitenant solution is one used by multiple customers, or tenants. Tenants are distinct from users. Multiple users from a single organization, company, or group form a single tenant. Examples of multitenant applications include:

- Business-to-business (B2B) solutions, such as accounting software, work tracking, and other software as a service (SaaS) products.
- Business-to-consumer (B2C) solutions, such as music streaming, photo sharing, and social network services.
- Enterprise-wide platform solutions, such as a shared Kubernetes cluster that's used by multiple business units within an organization.
