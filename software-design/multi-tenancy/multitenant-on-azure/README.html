<p>In this series, we use the term <em>tenant</em> to refer to <strong>your</strong> tenants, which might be your customers or groups of users. Our guidance is intended to help you to build your own multitenant software solutions on top of the Azure platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) also includes the concept of a tenant to refer to individual directories, and it uses the term <em>multitenancy</em> to refer to interactions between multiple Azure AD tenants. Although the terms are the same, the concepts are not. When we need to refer to the Azure AD concept of a tenant, we disambiguate it by using the full term <em>Azure AD tenant</em>.</p>

<h3 id="_scope">Scope</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Azure is itself a multitenant service, and some of our guidance is based on our experience with running large multitenant solutions, the focus of this series is on helping you build your own multitenant services, while harnessing the power of the Azure platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, when you design a solution, there are many areas you need to consider. The content in this section is specific to how you design for multitenancy. We don&#8217;t cover all of the features of the Azure services, or all of the architectural design considerations for every application. You should read this guide in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/index">Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework</a> and the documentation for each Azure service that you use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_intended_audience">Intended audience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The guidance provided in this series is applicable to anyone building a multitenant application in Azure. The audience also includes independent software vendors (ISVs) and startups who are building SaaS products, whether they are targeted for businesses or consumers. It also includes anyone building a product or platform that&#8217;s intended to be used by multiple customers or tenants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The content throughout this series is designed to be useful for technical decision-makers, like chief technology officers (CTOs) and architects, and anyone designing or implementing a multitenant solution on Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p><em>Managed service providers</em> (MSPs) manage and operate Azure environments on behalf of their customers, and work with multiple Azure Active Directory tenants in the process. This is another form of multitenancy, but it&#8217;s focused on managing Azure resources across multiple Azure Active Directory tenants. This series isn&#8217;t intended to provide guidance on these matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the series is likely to be helpful for ISVs who build software for MSPs, or for anyone else who builds and deploys multitenant software.</p>

<p><a href="approaches/README.html">Architectural approaches for multitenancy</a>: This section describes the approaches you can consider when designing and building multitenant solutions, by using key cloud resource types. The section includes a discussion how to build multitenant solutions with compute, networking, storage, and data components, as well as deployment, configuration, governance, and cost management.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The architectural approaches are intended to be useful for solution architects and lead developers.</p>

<h2 id="_architectural_considerations_for_a_multitenant_solution">Architectural considerations for a multitenant solution</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re considering a multitenant architecture, there are several decisions you need to make and elements you need to consider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a multitenant architecture, you share some or all of your resources between tenants. This process means that a multitenant architecture can give you cost and operational efficiency. However, multitenancy introduces complexities, including the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you define what a tenant is, for your specific solution? Does a tenant correspond to a customer, a user, or a group of users (like a team)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will you deploy your infrastructure to support multitenancy, and how much isolation will you have between tenants?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What commercial pricing models will your solution offer, and how will your pricing models affect your multitenancy requirements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What level of service do you need to provide to your tenants? Consider performance, resiliency, security, and compliance requirements, like data residency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you plan to grow your business or solution, and will it scale to the number of tenants you expect?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do any of your tenants have unusual or special requirements? For example, does your biggest customer need higher performance or stronger guarantees than others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will you monitor, manage, automate, scale, and govern your Azure environment, and how will multitenancy impact this?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever your architecture, it&#8217;s essential that you have a clear understanding of your customers' or tenants' requirements. If you have made sales commitments to customers, or if you have contractual obligations or compliance requirements to meet, then you need to know what those requirements are, when you architect your solution. But equally, your customers may have implicit expectations about how things should work, or how you should behave, which could affect the way you design a multitenant solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, imagine you&#8217;re building a multitenant solution that you sell to businesses in the financial services industry. Your customers have very strict security requirements, and they need you to provide a comprehensive list of every domain name that your solution uses, so they can add it to their firewall&#8217;s allowlist. This requirement affects the Azure services you use and the level of isolation that you have to provide between your tenants. They also require that their solution has a minimum level of resiliency. There may be many similar expectations, both explicit and implicit, that you need to consider across your whole solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we outline the considerations that you should give, the requirements you should elicit, and some of the tradeoffs you need to make, when you are planning a multitenant architecture.</p>
