<p>Azure provides many options for organizing your resources. In a multitenant solution, there are specific tradeoffs to consider, when you plan your resource organization strategy. In this article, we review two core elements of organizing your Azure resources: tenant isolation and scale-out across multiple resources. We also describe how to work with Azure&#8217;s resource limits and quotas, and how to scale your solution beyond these limits.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_key_considerations_and_requirements">Key considerations and requirements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tenant_isolation_requirements">Tenant isolation requirements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you deploy a multitenant solution in Azure, you need to decide whether you dedicate resources to each tenant or share resources between multiple tenants. Throughout the multitenancy approaches and <a href="../services/README.html">service-specific guidance</a> sections of this series, we describe the options and trade-offs for many categories of resources. In general, there are a range of options for tenant isolation. Review <a href="../considerations/tenancy-models.html">Tenancy models to consider for a multitenant solution</a> for more guidance about how to decide on your isolation model.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scale">Scale</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Azure resources, as well as resource groups and subscriptions, impose limits that can affect your ability to scale. You might need to consider <em>scaling out</em> or <em>bin packing</em> to meet your planned number of tenants or your planned system load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you know with certainty that you won&#8217;t grow to large numbers of tenants or to a high load, don&#8217;t overengineer your scale-out plan. But if you plan for your solution to grow, carefully consider your scale-out plan. Ensure that you architect for scale, by following the guidance in this article.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have an automated deployment process and need to scale across resources, determine how you&#8217;ll deploy and assign tenants across multiple resource instances. For example, how will you detect that you&#8217;re approaching the number of tenants that can be assigned to a specific resource? Will you plan to deploy new resources just in time for when you need them? Or, will you deploy a pool of resources <em>ahead of time</em> so they&#8217;re ready for you to use when you need them?</p>

In the early stages of design and development, you might not choose to implement an automated scale-out process. You should still consider and clearly document the processes required to scale as you grow.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also important to avoid making assumptions in your code and configuration, which can limit your ability to scale. For example, you might need to scale out to multiple storage accounts. Ensure your application tier doesn&#8217;t assume that it only connects to a single storage account for all tenants.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tenant_isolation">Tenant isolation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Azure resources are deployed and managed through a hierarchy. Most <em>resources</em> are deployed into <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal">resource groups</a>, which are contained in <em>subscriptions</em>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview">Management groups</a> logically group subscriptions together. All of these hierarchical layers are associated with an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory">Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you determine how to deploy resources for each tenant, you might isolate at different levels in the hierarchy. Each option is valid for certain types of multitenant solutions, and comes with benefits and tradeoffs. It&#8217;s also common to combine approaches, using different isolation models for different components of a solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_isolation_within_a_shared_resource">Isolation within a shared resource</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might choose to share an Azure resource among multiple tenants, and run all of their workloads on a single instance.Review the <a href="../services/README.html">service-specific guidance</a> for the Azure services you use to understand any specific considerations or options that might be important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run single instances of a resource, you need to consider any service limits, subscription limits, or quotas that might be reached as you scale.For example, there&#8217;s a maximum number of nodes that are supported by an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, and there&#8217;s an upper limit on the number of transactions per second that are supported by a storage account.Consider how you&#8217;ll <a href="#_bin_packing">scale to multiple shared resources</a> as you approach these limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to ensure your application code is fully aware of multitenancy, and that it restricts access to the data for a specific tenant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an illustration of the shared resource approach, suppose Contoso is building a multitenant SaaS application that includes a web application, a database, and a storage account.They might decide to deploy shared resources, and they&#8217;d use these resources to service all of their customers.In the following diagram, a single set of resources is shared by all the customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_separate_resources_in_a_resource_group">Separate resources in a resource group</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also deploy dedicated resources for each tenant. You might deploy an entire copy of your solution for a single tenant. Or, you might share some components between tenants and deploy other components that are dedicated to a specific tenant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend that you use resource groups to manage resources with the same lifecycle. In some multitenant systems, it makes sense to deploy resources for multiple tenants into a single resource group or a set of resource groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important that you consider how you deploy and manage these resources, including <a href="deployment-configuration.html#_resource_management_responsibility">whether the deployment of tenant-specific resources is initiated by your deployment pipeline or your application</a>. You also need to determine how you&#8217;ll <a href="cost-management-allocation.html">clearly identify that specific resources relate to specific tenants</a>. Consider using a clear <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging">naming convention strategy</a>, <a href="cost-management-allocation.html#_allocate_costs_by_using_resource_tags">resource tags</a>, or a tenant catalog database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s a good practice to use separate resource groups for the resources you share between multiple tenants and the resources that you deploy for individual tenants. However, for some resources, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resources-without-resource-group-limit">Azure limits the number of resources of a single type that can be deployed into a resource group</a>. This limit means you might need to <a href="#_resource_group_and_subscription_limits">scale across multiple resource groups</a> as you grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Contoso has three customers: Adventure Works, Fabrikam, and Tailwind. They might choose to share the web application and storage account between the three customers, and then deploy individual databases for each tenant. In the following diagram, each customer is assigned a resource group that contains shared resources and a resource group that contains a database.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_separate_resource_groups_in_a_subscription">Separate resource groups in a subscription</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you deploy a set of resources for each tenant, consider using dedicated tenant-specific resource groups. For example, when you follow the <a href="README.html#_deployment_stamps_pattern">Deployment Stamps pattern</a>, each stamp should be deployed into its own resource group. You can consider deploying multiple tenant-specific resource groups into a shared Azure subscription, which enables you to easily configure policies and access control rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might choose to create a set of resource groups for each tenant, and also shared resource groups for any shared resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you deploy tenant-specific resource groups into shared subscriptions, be aware of the maximum number of resource groups in each subscription, and other subscription-level limits that apply to the resources you deploy. As you approach these limits, you might need to <a href="#_resource_group_and_subscription_limits">scale across multiple subscriptions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our example, Contoso might choose to deploy a stamp for each of their customers and place the stamps in dedicated resource groups within a single subscription. In the following diagram, a subscription, which contains three resource groups, is created for each customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="./images/isolation-resource-group.png" alt="isolation resource group">
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_separate_subscriptions">Separate subscriptions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By deploying tenant-specific subscriptions, you can completely isolate tenant-specific resources. Additionally, because most quotas and limits apply within a subscription, using a separate subscription per tenant ensures that each tenant has full use of any applicable quotas. For some Azure billing account types, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/programmatically-create-subscription">you can programmatically create subscriptions</a>. You can also use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations">Azure reservations</a> across subscriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make you are aware of the number of subscriptions that you can create. The maximum number of subscriptions might differ, depending on your commercial relationship with Microsoft or a Microsoft partner, such as if you have an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/programmatically-create-subscription-enterprise-agreement?tabs=rest#limitations-of-azure-enterprise-subscription-creation-api">enterprise agreement</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it can be more difficult to request quota increases, when you work across a large number of subscriptions. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/reserved-vm-instances/quotaapi">Quota API</a> provides a programmatic interface for some resource types. However, for many resource types, quota increases must be requested by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#managing-limits">initiating a support case</a>. It can also be challenging to work with Azure support agreements and support cases, when you work with many subscriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider grouping your tenant-specific subscriptions into a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview">management group</a> hierarchy, to enable easy management of access control rules and policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose Contoso decided to create separate Azure subscriptions for each of their three customers, as shown in the following diagram. Each subscription contains a resource group, with the complete set of resources for that customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/isolation-subscription.png" alt="isolation subscription">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each subscription contains a resource group, with the complete set of resources for that customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They use a management group to simplify the management of their subscriptions. By including Production in the management group&#8217;s name, they can clearly distinguish any production tenants from non-production or test tenants. Non-production tenants would have different Azure access control rules and policies applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of their subscriptions are associated with a single Azure Active Directory tenant. Using a single Azure AD tenant means that the Contoso team&#8217;s identities, including users and service principals, can be used throughout their entire Azure estate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_separate_subscriptions_in_separate_azure_ad_tenants">Separate subscriptions in separate Azure AD tenants</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to manually create individual Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants for each of your tenants, or to deploy your resources into subscriptions within your customers' Azure AD tenants. However, working with multiple Azure AD tenants makes it more difficult to authenticate, to manage role assignments, to apply global policies, and to perform many other management operations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>We advise against creating multiple Azure Active Directory tenants for most multitenant solutions</strong>. Working across Azure AD tenants introduces extra complexity and reduces your ability to scale and manage your resources. Typically, this approach is only used by managed service providers (MSPs), who operate Azure environments on behalf of their customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single Azure AD tenant can be used by multiple separate subscriptions and Azure resources.

<p>In situations where you need to manage Azure resources in subscriptions that are tied to multiple Azure AD tenants, consider using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/overview">Azure Lighthouse</a> to help manage your resources across your Azure AD tenants.</p>

<h3 id="_bin_packing">Bin packing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of your resource isolation model, it&#8217;s important to consider when and how your solution will scale out across multiple resources. You might need to scale your resources, as the load on your system increases, or as the number of tenants grows. Consider <em>bin packing</em> to deploy an optimal number of resources for your requirements.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_resource_limits">Resource limits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Azure resources have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits">limits and quotas</a> that must be considered in your solution planning. For example, resources might support a maximum number of concurrent requests or tenant-specific configuration settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way you configure and use each resource also affects the scalability of that resource. For example, given a certain amount of compute resources, your application can successfully respond to a defined number of transactions per second. Beyond this point, you might need to scale out. Performance testing helps you to identify the point at which your resources no longer meet your requirements.</p>

<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The principle of scaling to multiple resources applies even when you work with services that support multiple instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, Azure App Service supports scaling out the number of instances of your plan, but there are limits for how far you can scale a single plan. In a high-scale multitenant app, you might exceed these limits and need to deploy additional App Service resources to match your growth.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you share some of your resources between tenants, you should first determine the number of tenants that the resource supports, when it&#8217;s configured according to your requirements. Then, deploy as many resources as you need to serve your total number of tenants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose you deploy an Azure Application Gateway, as part of a multitenant SaaS solution. You review your application design, test the application gateway&#8217;s performance under load, and review its configuration. Then, you determine that a single application gateway resource can be shared among 100 customers. According to your organization&#8217;s growth plan, you expect to onboard 150 customers in your first year, so you need to plan to deploy multiple application gateways to service your expected load.</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/bin-pack-resource.png" alt="bin pack resource">

<p>In the previous diagram, there are two application gateways. The first gateway is dedicated to customers 1 through 100, and the second is dedicated to customers 101 through 200.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_resource_group_and_subscription_limits">Resource group and subscription limits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you work with shared or dedicated resources, it&#8217;s important to account for limits. Azure limits the number of resources that can be <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#resource-group-limits">deployed into a resource group</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#subscription-limits">into an Azure subscription</a>. As you approach these limits, you need to plan to scale across multiple resource groups or subscriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose you deploy a dedicated application gateway, for each of your customers, into a shared resource group. For some resources, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resources-without-resource-group-limit">Azure supports deploying up to 800 resources of the same type</a> into a single resource group. So, when you reach this limit, you need to deploy any new application gateways into another resource group. In the following diagram, there are two resource groups. Each resource group contains 800 application gateways.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bin_pack_tenants_across_resource_groups_and_subscriptions">Bin pack tenants across resource groups and subscriptions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also apply the bin packing concept across resources, resource groups, and subscriptions. For example, when you have a small number of tenants you might be able to deploy a single resource and share it among all of your tenants. The following diagram shows bin packing into a single resource.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="./images/bin-pack-resources-2.png" alt="bin pack resources 2">

<p>Over time, you might reach the limit of the number of resources in a single resource group, and you would then deploy multiple (<em>R</em>) resources into multiple (<em>G</em>) resource groups. The following diagram shows bin packing across multiple resources, in multiple resource groups.</p>
