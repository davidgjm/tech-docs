<h2 id="_context_and_problem">Context and problem</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications often need to process a sequence of messages in the order they arrive, while still being able to scale out to handle increased load. In a distributed architecture, processing these messages in order is not straightforward, because the workers can scale independently and often pull messages independently, using a <a href="competing-consumers.html">Competing Consumers pattern</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an order tracking system receives a ledger containing orders and the relevant operations on those orders. These operations could be to create an order, add a transaction to the order, modify a past transaction, or delete an order. In this system, operations must be performed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, but only at the order level. However, the initial queue receives a ledger containing transactions for many orders, which may be interleaved.</p>

<p>Push related messages into categories within the queuing system, and have the queue listeners lock and pull only from one category, one message at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s what the general Sequential Convoy pattern looks like:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the queue, messages for different categories may be interleaved, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<h2 id="_issues_and_considerations">Issues and considerations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Category/scale unit. What property of your incoming messages can you scale out on? In the order tracking scenario, this property is the order ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughput. What is your target message throughput? If it is very high, you may need to reconsider your FIFO requirements. For example, can you enforce a start/end message, sort by time, then send a batch for processing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service capabilities. Does your choice of message bus allow for one-at-a-time processing of messages within a queue or category of a queue?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolvability. How will you add a new category of message to the system? For example, suppose the ledger system described above is specific one customer. If you needed to onboard a new customer, could you have a set of ledger processors that distribute work per customer ID?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that consumers might receive a message out of order, due to variable network latency when sending messages. Consider using sequence numbers to verify ordering. You might also include a special "end of sequence" flag in the last message of a transaction. Stream processing technologies such as Spark or Azure Stream Analytics can process messages in order within a time window.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_when_to_use_this_pattern">When to use this pattern</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use this pattern when:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have messages that arrive in order and must be processed in the same order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving messages are or can be "categorized" in such a way that the category becomes a unit of scale for the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This pattern might not be suitable for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extremely high throughput scenarios (millions of messages/minute or second), as the FIFO requirement limits the scaling that can be done by the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_example">Example</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Azure, this pattern can be implemented using Azure Service Bus <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sessions">message sessions</a>. For the consumers, you can use either Logic Apps with the Service Bus peek-lock connector or Azure Functions with the Service Bus trigger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the previous order-tracking example, process each ledger message in the order it&#8217;s received, and send each transaction to another queue where the category is set to the order ID. A transaction will never span multiple orders in this scenario, so consumers process each category in parallel but FIFO within the category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ledge processor fan outs the messages by de-batching the content of each message in the first queue:</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ledger processor takes care of:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Walking the ledger one transaction at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting the session ID of the message to match the order ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending each ledger transaction to a secondary queue with the session ID set to the order ID.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consumers listen to the secondary queue where they process all messages with matching order IDs in order from the queue. Consumers use peek-lock mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When considering scalability, the ledger queue is a primary bottleneck. Different transactions posted to the ledger could reference the same order ID. However, messages can fan out after the ledger to the number of orders in a serverless environment.</p>
