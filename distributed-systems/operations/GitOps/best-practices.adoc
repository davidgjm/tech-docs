This is what we think you need to do:

. Keep a record in Git of important interactions with the system: who made changes, when and why
. Donâ€™t rebuild images from scratch unnecessarily, if you can update config instead. Build each container image just once and 'promote' it through each test sequence / environment, do not rebuild each time. But you must still update your declarative config changes in Git.
. Use pull based deployment - do not let CI push updates into the Kubernetes cluster or use kubectl by hand
