== Introduction
Docker introduced the concept of a container image, which is a standard TAR file that combines:

* *Rootfs (container root filesystem)*: A directory on the system that looks like the standard root (/) of the operating system. For example, a directory with /usr, /var, /home, etc.
* *JSON file (container configuration)*: Specifies how to run the rootfs; for example, what command or entrypoint to run in the rootfs when the container starts; environment variables to set for the container; the container's working directory; and a few other settings.

Docker "tar's up" the rootfs and the JSON file to create the base image. This enables you to install additional content on the rootfs, create a new JSON file, and tar the difference between the original image and the new image with the updated JSON file. This creates a *layered image*.

Container storage is usually a copy-on-write (COW) layered filesystem. When you pull down a container image from a container registry, you first need to untar the rootfs and place it on disk. If you have multiple layers that make up your image, each layer is downloaded and stored on a different layer on the COW filesystem. The COW filesystem allows each layer to be stored separately, which maximizes sharing for layered images. Container engines often support multiple types of container storage, including *overlay, devicemapper, btrfs, aufs, and zfs*.
