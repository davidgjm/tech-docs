NOTE:  All but the code Response Type value, which is defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], are defined in the OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices [OAuth.Responses] specification. NOTE: While OAuth 2.0 also defines the token Response Type value for the Implicit Flow, OpenID Connect does not use this Response Type, since no ID Token would be returned.
