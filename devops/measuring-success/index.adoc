=== Choosing the Right Metrics
In 1911, Fredrick W. Taylor published http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6435[_The Principles of Scientific Management_], which discussed approaches to optimizing two important variables: Output quality and worker compensation. Taylor recognized that successful firms work collaboratively, with management and workers jointly setting goals and developing methods and tools to achieve both profitability and proportionate compensation. Nowhere in this text—or in any of his recorded speeches or documents—does he say, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” He never said that for two reasons: First, he did not believe it; second, it is not true. What he did emphasize was that #if you do measure it, you will manage it.# That was a warning: Pick the right metrics or you will exert effort pursuing a meaningless goal.

Here are some potential cloud performance metrics compiled from several cloud providers and users across various industries, not-for-profits and governmental agencies:

- Service Metrics
* Reliability – mean time between failure (MTBF)
* Availability – Uptime, expressed as a meaningful percentage of demand
* Serviceability – Mean time to repair (MTTR)
- IT Metrics
* Capacity
* Latency
* Bandwidth
* Response time

- Strategic Metrics
* Business agility
* Customer engagement
* Customer reach
* Financial impact
* Solution performance

The journey to cloud excellence starts with developing the metrics that are most relevant to your business goals. Picking the right metrics with the right scale matters. #As a rule of thumb, generally right beats precisely wrong.#
