- A trigger tells a Pipeline to run.
- A pipeline is made up of one or more stages. A pipeline can deploy to one or more environments.
- A stage is a way of organizing jobs in a pipeline and each stage can have one or more jobs.
- Each job runs on one agent. A job can also be agentless.
- Each agent runs a job that contains one or more steps.
- A step can be a task or script and is the smallest building block of a pipeline.
- A task is a pre-packaged script that performs an action, such as invoking a REST API or publishing a build artifact.
- An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a run.

=== Jobs

.Syntax
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: string
  dependsOn: string
  condition: string

==== Sequential jobs
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Debug build
- job: Release
  dependsOn: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Release build
----

==== Parallel jobs (#no dependencies#):
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: Windows
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Windows
- job: macOS
  pool:
    vmImage: 'macOS-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from macOS
- job: Linux
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Linux

==== Fan-out
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial job
- job: SubsequentA
  dependsOn: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent A
- job: SubsequentB
  dependsOn: InitialJob

==== Fan-in

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: InitialA
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial A
- job: InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial B
- job: Subsequent
  dependsOn:
  - InitialA
  - InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent
----

=== Conditions
You can specify the conditions under which each job runs. #By default, a job runs if it does not depend on any other job, or if all of the jobs that it depends on have completed and succeeded.# You can customize this behavior by forcing a job to run even if a previous job fails or by specifying a custom condition.


[cols="20m,40,40"]
|===
|Status check function |Explanation |Example

|always()
|Always evaluates to `True` (even when canceled).
a|
[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
- job: Foo

  steps:
  - script: echo Hello!
    condition: always() # this step will always run, even if the pipeline is canceled

- job: Bar
  dependsOn: Foo
  condition: failed() # this job will only run if Foo fails
----

|canceled()
|Evaluates to `True` if the pipeline was canceled.
|

|failed()
a|For a job:

- With no arguments, evaluates to `True` only if any previous job in the dependency graph failed.
- With job names as arguments, evaluates to True only if any of those jobs failed.
|

|succeeded()
a|For a job:

- With no arguments, evaluates to `True` only if all previous jobs in the dependency graph succeeded or partially succeeded.
- With job names as arguments, evaluates to `True` if all of those jobs succeeded or partially succeeded.
- Evaluates to `False` if the pipeline is canceled.
|

|succeededOrFailed()
a|For a job:

- With no arguments, evaluates to `True` regardless of whether any jobs in the dependency graph succeeded or failed.
- With job names as arguments, evaluates to `True` whether any of those jobs succeeded or failed.

This is like `always()`, except it will evaluate `False` when the pipeline is canceled.

==== variables in conditions

variables:
  isMain: $[eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')]

stages:
- stage: A
  jobs:
  - job: A1
    steps:
      - script: echo Hello Stage A!

- stage: B
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables.isMain, true))

== GitLab
Pipelines are the top-level component of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

Pipelines comprise:

- *Jobs*, which define _what_ to do. For example, jobs that compile or test code.
- *Stages*, which define _when_ to run the jobs. For example, stages that run tests after stages that compile the code.
Jobs are executed by runners. Multiple jobs in the same stage are executed in parallel, if there are enough concurrent runners.

If _all_ jobs in a stage succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.

If _any_ job in a stage fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed and the pipeline ends early.

In general, pipelines are executed automatically and require no intervention once created. However, there are also times when you can manually interact with a pipeline.

A typical pipeline might consist of four stages, executed in the following order:

. A `build` stage, with a job called `compile`.
. A `test` stage, with two jobs called `test1` and `test2`.
. A `staging` stage, with a job called `deploy-to-stage`.
. A `production` stage, with a job called `deploy-to-prod`.

A https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops#step[step] can be a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops#task[task] or https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops#script[script] and is the smallest building block of a pipeline. Builtin tasks and custom tasks are available.

a|*https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#defining-steps[Steps] as containers*

A `Step` is a reference to a container image that executes a specific tool on a specific input and produces a specific output.

|flattened with at least one `script` clause
|Each step is either a shell script that will be executed, or an _action_ that will be run. Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other.
|Steps are collections of executable commands, which are run during a job.
The `checkout` key is required under `steps` to checkout your code. The `run` key enables addition of arbitrary, multi-line shell command scripting.

In addition to the `run` key, keys for `when`, `save_cache`, `restore_cache`, `store_artifacts`, `store_test_results`, and `add_ssh_keys` are nested under Steps.
a|*Step* types:

- Command step
- Wait step
- Block step
- Input step
- Trigger step
- Group step

|timeouts
|`timeoutInMinutes`
|`timeout`: "0h1m30s"
|Column 4, row 4
a|`jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`

The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360

If the timeout exceeds the job execution time limit for the runner, the job will be canceled when the execution time limit is met instead.
