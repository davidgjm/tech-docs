Non-Functional Requirements mainly answer the following question:

What should the system deal with?

== Performance
* Always talk in numbers. Rule of thumb:
- B2C scenarios: end-2-end latency in **1 second**
- B2B scenarios: within ** 100 ms**
* Latency & throughput

=== Latency & throughput

==== Latency

[quote]
____
How much does it take to perform a single task?
____

==== Throughput
[quote]
____
How many tasks can be performed in a given time unit?
____

Examples:
- How many users can be saved in the database in a minute?
- How many files can be read in a second?

== Load
* Quantity of work without crashing

TIP: Always plan for extreme cases

=== Examples
- In Web API - How many concurrent requests without crashing?

== Data Volume
* How much data the system will accumulate over time?
* helps with
- deciding on database type
- designing queries
- storage planning
* Two aspects
- Data required on "day one"
- Data growth

=== Example
* Day one: 500 MB
* Annual Growth: 2 TB


== Concurrent Users
[quote]
____
How many users will be using the system simultaneously?
____

=== Concurrent users vs load

[cols="2"]
|===
|Concurrent Users
|Including "Dead times"

|Load
|Actual Requests

.Rule of thumb
====
Concurrent = Load X 10

== SLA
