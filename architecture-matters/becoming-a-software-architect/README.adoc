== Responsibility of a software architect

=== Baseline requirements
* Fast
* Secure
* Reliable
* Easy to maintain

TIP: Think about Well Architected Framework from AWS/Azure. See xref:../../cloud/README.adoc[Cloud Architecture] for details

== Why an architect should code

* Architecture's trustworthiness
* Support the developers
* Respect

== Architecture Process

. Understand the System's Requirements
. Understand the non-functional requirements
. Map the Components
. Select the technology stack
. Design the architecture
. Write architecture document
. Support the team

=== Understand the Non-Functional Requirements

* Define technical & service level attributes
 - ie. # of users, loads, volumes, performance
* Not always known to the client or analyst
* Much more important than regular requirements

=== Map the Components
* Represent the tasks of the system
* Two goals:
 - Understand the system functionality
 - Communicate your understanding to the client
* Non-Technical (technological stack is not in place yet.)

NOTE: It's just a map displaying various capabilities of a system

=== Design the architecture

* Involve developers as early and much as possible. Benefits
- Help software architect to learn unknown scenarios early
- Grow ambassadors for software architects since this is a joint work and developers can easily buy-in.


=== Write the architecture document
* Describe the process and the architecture
* Must be relevant to all participants
