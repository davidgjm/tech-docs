General recommendations

In the best case, the above might have been a mildly interesting primer on handling time values in software. What would be some useful recommendations that we can offer for handling such timestamps in log aggregation scenarios? What should we keep in mind when formatting the timestamps in logs?

    Include and maintain explicit time zone offset information. Explicit is better than implicit, as the Zen of Python puts it. If the time zone is omitted or discarded too early, correct interpretation of time values becomes a guessing game. In the worst case, it leads to hard-to-discover bugs with costly mitigations. RFC 3339 provides a robust and concise format to use, that is universally known and human-readable.
    Otherwise, normalize to location-independent universal time. If it’s not feasible to include time zone information, agree on a common reference frame for all involved systems. The numeric POSIX time is a good smallest common denominator for that purpose.
    Choose and maintain sufficient precision. The appropriate precision required might ultimately vary between high-precision industrial environments to low-volume batch-oriented systems. But across them all, it is impossible to recover lost precision at a later stage in the pipeline. As such, the precision should only be reduced if technical limitations demand it. An ambiguous order of events in the logs might hinder investigations or even lead to false conclusions about the causality.
    Otherwise, add a sequence counter. If the timestamps can not be produced with sufficient precision to ensure an absolute ordering, consider artificially adding a monotonically increasing counter to the event as early as possible in the pipeline to break the tie between “simultaneous” events.
    Synchronize time across systems. All of the above is not sufficient to ensure that log events from different machines can be correlated correctly — their clocks need to be synchronized to within use case–specific tolerances, which usually relates to the required precision of the time values. A common mechanism for clock synchronization is the Network Time Protocol already mentioned above.
    Otherwise, rewrite the timestamp with a consistent time value at the earliest opportunity. If technical limitations make it impossible to synchronize the clocks of the entity emitting the log event, it is sufficient for some applications to add or rewrite the timestamp to a synchronized and consistent value at a later stage in the log processing pipeline. This is what Logstash and Filebeat do when they receive events without timestamps. The efficacy of that highly depends on properties of the specific deployment scenarios, though, such as log event transmission jitter and latency. The closer the rewriting entity is to the source the more accurate the timing in most cases.

==== Timezone
*UTC* time zone is strongly recommended.

==== Date format

Either ISO9601 or RFC3339 works great for log collection & aggregation platforms.

==== Examples

=== Configuration for Spring Boot applications

The snippet below uses SLF4J as the logging framework and `logback` as the backend implementation. See for https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.logging.custom-log-configuration[Custom Log Configuration] details
