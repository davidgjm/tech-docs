<p>You should aggregate log data from your application, workload components, services, and API calls to a service such as CloudWatch Logs. Generate metrics from observations of necessary log content to enable insight into the performance of operations activities.</p>

<p>You are asked by the network design team for current network bandwidth utilization rates. You provide the current metrics, network utilization is at 35%. They reduce circuit capacity as a cost savings measure causing widespread connectivity issues as your point-in-time measurement did not reflect the trend in utilization rates.</p>

<li>
<p>Your router has failed. It has been logging non-critical memory errors with greater and greater frequency up until its complete failure. You did not detect this trend and as a result did not replace the faulty memory before the router caused a service interruption.</p>
