= Operational readiness and change management

Evaluate the operational readiness of your workload, processes, procedures, and personnel to understand the operational risks related to your workload. Manage the flow of change into your environments.

You should use a consistent process (including manual or automated checklists) to know when you are ready to go live with your workload or a change. This will also enable you to find any areas that you need to make plans to address. You will have runbooks that document your routine activities and playbooks that guide your processes for issue resolution. Use a mechanism to manage changes that supports the delivery of business value and help mitigate risks associated to change.
