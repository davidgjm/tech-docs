<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_perform_operations_as_code">Perform operations as code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_make_frequent_small_reversible_changes">Make frequent, small, reversible changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_refine_operations_procedures_frequently">Refine operations procedures frequently</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload, evolve your procedures appropriately. Set up regular game days to review and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_anticipate_failure">Anticipate failure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_learn_from_all_operational_failures">Learn from all operational failures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_best_practices">Best Practices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four best practice areas for operational excellence in the cloud:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolve</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your organization’s leadership defines business objectives. Your organization must understand requirements and priorities and use these to organize and conduct work to support the achievement of business outcomes. Your workload must emit the information necessary to support it. Implementing services to enable integration, deployment, and delivery of your workload will enable an increased flow of beneficial changes into production by automating repetitive processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be risks inherent in the operation of your workload. You must understand those risks and make an informed decision to enter production. Your teams must be able to support your workload. Business and operational metrics derived from desired business outcomes will enable you to understand the health of your workload, your operations activities, and respond to incidents. Your priorities will change as your business needs and business environment changes. Use these as a feedback loop to continually drive improvement for your organization and the operation of your workload.</p>
