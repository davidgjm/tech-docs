= OPS02-BP05 Mechanisms exist to identify responsibility and ownership

Where no individual or team is identified, there are defined escalation paths to someone with the authority to assign ownership or plan for that need to be addressed.

*Benefits of establishing this best practice*: Understanding who has responsbility or ownership allows you to reach out to the proper team or team member to make a request or transition a task. Having an identified person who has the authority to assign responsbility or ownership or plan to address needs reduces the risk of inaction and needs not being addressed.

*Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established*: High

== Implementation guidance

Mechanisms exist to identify responsibility and ownership: Provide accessible mechanisms for members of your organization to discover and identify ownership and responsibility. These mechanisms will enable them to identify who to contact, team or individual, for specific needs.
