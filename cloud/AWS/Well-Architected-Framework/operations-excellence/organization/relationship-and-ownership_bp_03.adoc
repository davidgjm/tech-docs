== Implementation guidance

- Operations activities have identified owners responsible for their performance: Capture the responsibility for performing processes and procedures used in your environment

* Identify process and procedures: Identify the operations activities conducted in support of your workloads. Document these activities in a discoverable location.

* Define who is responsible to perform each activity: Identify the team responsible for an activity. Ensure they have the details of the activity, and the necessary skills and correct permissions, access, and tools to perform the activity. They must understand the condition under which it is to be perform (for example, on an event or schedule). Make this information discoverable so that members of your organization can identify who they need to contact, team or individual, for specific needs.
