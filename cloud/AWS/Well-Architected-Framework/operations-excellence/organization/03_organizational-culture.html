<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set expectations: Define and publish goals for your organizations including how they will be measured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track achievement of goals: Measure the incremental achievement of goals regularly and share the results so that appropriate action can be taken if outcomes are at risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the resources necessary to achieve your goals: Regularly review if resources are still appropriate, of if additional resources are needed based on: new information, changes to goals, responsibilities, or your business environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocate for your teams: Remain engaged with your teams so that you understand how they are doing and if there are external factors affecting them. When your teams are impacted by external factors, reevaluate goals and adjust targets as appropriate. Identify obstacles that are impeding your teams progress. Act on behalf of your teams to help address obstacles and remove unnecessary burdens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a driver for adoption of best practices: Acknowledge best practices that provide quantifiable benefits and recognize the creators and adopters. Encourage further adoption to magnify the benefits achieved.</p>
</li>

<p>The workload owner has defined guidance and scope empowering team members to respond when outcomes are at risk. Escalation mechanisms are used to get direction when events are outside of the defined scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Benefits of establishing this best practice</strong>: By testing and validating changes early, you are able to address issues with minimized costs and limit the impact on your customers. By testing prior to deployment you minimize the introduction of errors.</p>

<p>Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risk: Provide your team members the permissions, tools, and opportunity to practice the skills necessary to respond effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give your team members opportunity to practice the skills necessary to respond: Provide alternative safe environments where processes and procedures can be tested and trained upon safely. Perform game days to allow team members to gain experience responding to real world incidents in simulated and safe environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define and acknowledge team members' authority to take action: Specifically define team members authority to take action by assigning permissions and access to the workloads and components they support. Acknowledge that they are empowered to take action when outcomes are at risk.</p>

<p>Team members have mechanisms and are encouraged to escalate concerns to decision makers and stakeholders if they believe outcomes are at risk. Escalation should be performed early and often so that risks can be identified, and prevented from causing incidents.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Encourage early and frequent escalation: Organizationally acknowledge that escalation early and often is the best practice. Organizationally acknowledge and accept that escalations may prove to be unfounded, and that it is better to have the opportunity to prevent an incident then to miss that opportunity by not escalating.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a mechanism for escalation: Have documented procedures defining when and how escalation should occur. Document the series of people with increasing authority to take action or approve action and their contact information. Escalation should continue until the team member is satisfied that they have handed off the risk to a person able to address it, or they have contacted the person who owns the risk and liability for the operation of the workload. It is that person who ultimately owns all decisions with respect to their workload. Escalations should include the nature of the risk, the criticality of the workload, who is impacted, what the impact is, and the urgency, that is, when is the impact expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect employees who escalate: Have policy that protects team members from retribution if they escalate around a non-responsive decision maker or stakeholder. Have mechanisms in place to identify if this is occurring and respond appropriately.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mechanisms exist and are used to provide timely notice to team members of known risks and planned events. Necessary context, details, and time (when possible) are provided to support determining if action is necessary, what action is required, and to take action in a timely manner. For example, providing notice of software vulnerabilities so that patching can be expedited, or providing notice of planned sales promotions so that a change freeze can be implemented to avoid the risk of service disruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Planned events can be recorded in a change calendar or maintenance schedule so that team members can identify what activities are pending.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On AWS, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html">AWS Systems Manager Change Calendar</a> can be used to record these details. It supports programmatic checks of calendar status to determine if the calendar is open or closed to activity at a particular point of time. Operations activities can be planned around specific approved windows of time that are reserved for potentially disruptive activities. AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows allows you to schedule activities against instances and other <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/supported-resources.html#supported-resources-console">supported resources</a> to automate the activities and make those activities discoverable.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Document planned activities on a change calendar and provide notifications: Provide an accessible source of information where planned events can be discovered. Provide notifications of planned events from the same system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track events and activity that may have an impact on your workload: Monitoring vulnerability notifications and patch information to understand vulnerabilities in the wild and potential risks associated to your workload components. Provide notification to team members so that they can take action.</p>
