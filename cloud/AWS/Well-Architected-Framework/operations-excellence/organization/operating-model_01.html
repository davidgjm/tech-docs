<h1>Fully separated operating model</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following diagram, on the vertical axis we have Applications and Platform. Applications refer to the workload serving a business outcome and can be custom developed or purchased software. Platform refers to the physical and virtual infrastructure and other software that supports that workload.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the horizontal axis, we have Engineering and Operations. Engineering refers to the development, building, and testing of applications and infrastructure. Operations is the deployment, update, and ongoing support of applications and infrastructure.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In many organizations, this “fully separated” model is present. The activities in each quadrant are performed by a separate team.</strong> Work is passed between teams through mechanisms such as work requests, work queues, tickets, or by using an IT service management (ITSM) system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transition of tasks to or between teams increases complexity, and creates bottlenecks and delays. Requests may be delayed until they are a priority. Defects identified late may require significant rework and may have to pass through the same teams and their functions once again. If there are incidents that require action by engineering teams, their responses are delayed by the hand off activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a higher risk of misalignment when business, development, and operations teams are organized around the activities or functions that are being performed. This can lead to teams focusing on their specific responsibilities instead of focusing on achieving business outcomes. Teams may be narrowly specialized, physically isolated, or logically isolated, hindering communication and collaboration.</p>
