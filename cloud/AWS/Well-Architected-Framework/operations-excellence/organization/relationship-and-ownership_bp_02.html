<p>Define who owns the definition of a process or procedure: Uniquely identify the individual or team responsible for the specification of an activity. They are responsible to ensure it can be successfully performed by an adequately skilled team member with the correct permissions, access, and tools. If there are issues with performing that activity, the team members performing it are responsible to provide the detailed feedback necessary for the activitiy to be improved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capture ownership in the metadata of the activity artifact: Procedures automated in services like AWS Systems Manager, through documents, and AWS Lambda, as functions, support capturing metadata information as tags. Capture resource ownership using tags or resource groups, specifying ownership and contact information. Use AWS Organizations to create tagging polices and ensure ownership and contact information are captured.</p>
