<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you increase reliability. Keep these in mind as we discuss best practices:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Automatically recover from failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>By monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached. These KPIs should be a measure of business value, not of the technical aspects of the operation of the service. This allows for automatic notification and tracking of failures, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure. With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Test recovery procedures</dt>
<dd>
<p>In an on-premises environment, testing is often conducted to prove that the workload works in a particular scenario. Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies. In the cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your recovery procedures. You can use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. This approach exposes failure pathways that you can test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs, thus reducing risk.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload. Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don’t share a common point of failure.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Stop guessing capacity</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload (this is often the objective of denial of service attacks). In the cloud, you can monitor demand and workload utilization, and automate the addition or removal of resources to maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over- or under-provisioning. There are still limits, but some quotas can be controlled and others can be managed (see Manage Service Quotas and Constraints).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Manage change in automation</dt>
<dd>
<p>Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.</p>
</dd>

<h3 id="_resiliency_and_the_components_of_reliability">Resiliency, and the components of Reliability</h3>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Reliability of a workload in the cloud depends on several factors, the primary of which is Resiliency:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Resiliency</strong> is the ability of a workload to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions, such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other factors impacting workload reliability are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operational Excellence, which includes automation of changes, use of playbooks to respond to failures, and Operational Readiness Reviews (ORRs) to confirm that applications are ready for production operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security, which includes preventing harm to data or infrastructure from malicious actors, which would impact availability. For example, encrypt backups to ensure that data is secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Efficiency, which includes designing for maximum request rates and minimizing latencies for your workload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost Optimization, which includes trade-offs such as whether to spend more on EC2 instances to achieve static stability, or to rely on automatic scaling when more capacity is needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resiliency is the primary focus of this whitepaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other four aspects are also important and they are covered by their respective pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
. Many of the best practices here also address those aspects of reliability, but the focus is on resiliency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_availability"><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/availability.html">Availability</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Availability</em> (also known as <em>service availability</em>) is both a commonly used metric to quantitatively measure resiliency, as well as a target resiliency objective.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Availability is the percentage of time that a workload is available for use.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Available for use</em> means that it performs its agreed function successfully when required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This percentage is calculated over a period of time, such as a month, year, or trailing three years. Applying the strictest possible interpretation, availability is reduced anytime that the application isn’t operating normally, including both scheduled and unscheduled interruptions. We define availability as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/availability-formula.png" alt="availability formula">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Availability is a percentage uptime (such as 99.9%) over a period of time (commonly a month or year)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common short-hand refers only to the “number of nines”; for example, “five nines” translates to being 99.999% available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some customers choose to exclude scheduled service downtime (for example, planned maintenance) from the Total Time in the formula. However, this is not advised, as your users will likely want to use your service during these times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_measuring_availability_based_on_requests">Measuring availability based on requests.</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For your service it may be easier to count successful and failed requests instead of “time available for use”. In this case the following calculation can be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/availability-formula-requests.png" alt="availability formula requests">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is often measured for one-minute or five-minute periods. Then a monthly uptime percentage (time-base availability measurement) can be calculated from the average of these periods. If no requests are received in a given period it is counted at 100% available for that time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_calculating_availability_with_hard_dependencies">Calculating availability with hard dependencies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many systems have hard dependencies on other systems, where an interruption in a dependent system directly translates to an interruption of the invoking system. This is opposed to a soft dependency, where a failure of the dependent system is compensated for in the application. Where such hard dependencies occur, the invoking system’s availability is the product of the dependent systems’ availabilities. For example, if you have a system designed for 99.99% availability that has a hard dependency on two other independent systems that each are designed for 99.99% availability, the workload can theoretically achieve 99.97% availability:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avail<sub>invok</sub> × Avail<sub>dep1</sub> × Avail<sub>dep2</sub> = Avail<sub>workload</sub></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>99.99% × 99.99% × 99.99% = 99.97%</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s therefore important to understand your dependencies and their availability design goals as you calculate your own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_calculating_availability_with_redundant_components">Calculating availability with redundant components.</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a system involves the use of independent, redundant components (for example, redundant resources in different Availability Zones), the theoretical availability is computed as 100% minus the product of the component failure rates. For example, if a system makes use of two independent components, each with an availability of 99.9%, the effective availability of this dependency is 99.9999%:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/availability-redundant-components.png" alt="availability redundant components">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avail<sub>effective</sub> = Avail<sub>MAX</sub> − ( (100%−Avail<sub>dependency</sub>)×(100%−Avail<sub>dependency</sub>) )</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>99.9999% = 100% − (0.1%×0.1%)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Shortcut calculation</em>: If the availabilities of all components in your calculation consist solely of the digit nine, then you can sum the count of the number of nines digits to get your answer. In the above example two redundant, independent components with three nines availability results in six nines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_calculating_dependency_availability">Calculating dependency availability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some dependencies provide guidance on their availability, including availability design goals for many AWS services (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/appendix-a-designed-for-availability-for-select-aws-services.html">Appendix A: Designed-For Availability for Select AWS Services</a>). But in cases where this isn’t available (for example, a component where the manufacturer does not publish availability information), one way to estimate is to determine the <strong>Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)</strong> and <strong>Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)</strong>. An availability estimate can be established by:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/avail-est-formula.png" alt="avail est formula">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if the MTBF is 150 days and the MTTR is 1 hour, the availability estimate is 99.97%.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_disaster_recovery_dr_objectives">Disaster Recovery (DR) Objectives</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to availability objectives, your resiliency strategy should also include Disaster Recovery (DR) objectives based on strategies to recover your workload in case of a disaster event. Disaster Recovery focuses on one-time recovery objectives in response natural disasters, large-scale technical failures, or human threats such as attack or error. This is different than availability which measures mean resiliency over a period of time in response to component failures, load spikes, or software bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Defined by the organization. RTO is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Defined by the organization. RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. The relationship of RPO (Recovery Point Objective), RTO (Recovery Time Objective), and the disaster event.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RTO is similar to MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) in that both measure the time between the start of an outage and workload recovery. However MTTR is a mean value taken over several availability impacting events over a period of time, while RTO is a target, or maximum value allowed, for a <em>single</em> availability impacting event.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within AWS, we commonly divide services into the “data plane” and the “control plane.” The data plane is responsible for delivering real-time service while control planes are used to configure the environment. For example, Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS databases, and Amazon DynamoDB table read/write operations are all data plane operations. In contrast, launching new EC2 instances or RDS databases, or adding or changing table metadata in DynamoDB are all considered control plane operations. While high levels of availability are important for all of these capabilities, the data planes typically have higher availability design goals than the control planes. Therefore workloads with high availability requirements should avoid run-time dependency on control plane operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many AWS customers take a similar approach to critically evaluating their applications and identifying subcomponents with different availability needs. Availability design goals are then tailored to the different aspects, and the appropriate work efforts are executed to engineer the system. AWS has significant experience engineering applications with a range of availability design goals, including services with 99.999% or greater availability. AWS Solution Architects (SAs) can help you design appropriately for your availability goals. Involving AWS early in your design process improves our ability to help you meet your availability goals. Planning for availability is not only done before your workload launches. It’s also done continuously to refine your design as you gain operational experience, learn from real world events, and endure failures of different types. You can then apply the appropriate work effort to improve upon your implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The availability needs that are required for a workload must be aligned to the business need and criticality. <strong>By first defining business criticality framework with defined RTO, RPO, and availability, you can then assess each workload.</strong> Such an approach requires that the people involved in implementation of the workload are knowledgeable of the framework, and the impact their workload has on business needs.</p>
