<p>The code that implements these requests should not impose any side-effects. The same request repeated over the same resource should result in the same state. For example, sending multiple DELETE requests to the same URI should have the same effect, although the HTTP status code in the response messages may be different. The first DELETE request might return status code 204 (No Content), while a subsequent DELETE request might return status code 404 (Not Found).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A web API must return messages that contain the correct HTTP status code to enable the client to determine how to handle the result, the appropriate HTTP headers so that the client understands the nature of the result, and a suitably formatted body to enable the client to parse the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a POST operation should return status code 201 (Created) and the response message should include the URI of the newly created resource in the Location header of the response message.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_support_content_negotiation">Support content negotiation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The body of a response message may contain data in a variety of formats. For example, an HTTP GET request could return data in JSON, or XML format. When the client submits a request, it can include an Accept header that specifies the data formats that it can handle. These formats are specified as media types. For example, a client that issues a GET request that retrieves an image can specify an Accept header that lists the media types that the client can handle, such as <code>image/jpeg, image/gif, image/png</code>. When the web API returns the result, it should format the data by using one of these media types and specify the format in the Content-Type header of the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the client does not specify an Accept header, then use a sensible default format for the response body. As an example, the ASP.NET Web API framework defaults to JSON for text-based data.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_capture_exceptions_and_return_a_meaningful_response_to_clients">Capture exceptions and return a meaningful response to clients</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code that implements an HTTP operation should provide comprehensive exception handling rather than letting uncaught exceptions propagate to the framework. If an exception makes it impossible to complete the operation successfully, the exception can be passed back in the response message, but it should include a meaningful description of the error that caused the exception. The exception should also include the appropriate HTTP status code rather than simply returning status code 500 for every situation. For example, if a user request causes a database update that violates a constraint (such as attempting to delete a customer that has outstanding orders), you should return status code 409 (Conflict) and a message body indicating the reason for the conflict. If some other condition renders the request unachievable, you can return status code 400 (Bad Request). You can find a full list of HTTP status codes on the Status code definitions page on the W3C website.</p>

<p>Many web servers trap error conditions themselves before they reach the web API. For example, if you configure authentication for a web site and the user fails to provide the correct authentication information, the web server should respond with status code 401 (Unauthorized). Once a client has been authenticated, your code can perform its own checks to verify that the client should be able access the requested resource. If this authorization fails, you should return status code 403 (Forbidden).</p>

<h3 id="_support_client_side_caching">Support client-side caching</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports caching in clients and intermediate servers through which a request is routed by the use of the Cache-Control header. When a client application sends an HTTP GET request to the web API, the response can include a Cache-Control header that indicates whether the data in the body of the response can be safely cached by the client or an intermediate server through which the request has been routed, and for how long before it should expire and be considered out-of-date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example shows an HTTP GET request and the corresponding response that includes a Cache-Control header:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="HTTP">GET https://adventure-works.com/orders/2 HTTP/1.1</code></pre>

Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: ...
{"orderID":2,"productID":4,"quantity":2,"orderValue":10.00}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the Cache-Control header specifies that the data returned should be expired after 600 seconds, and is only suitable for a single client and must not be stored in a shared cache used by other clients (it is private). The Cache-Control header could specify public rather than private in which case the data can be stored in a shared cache, or it could specify no-store in which case the data must not be cached by the client.</p>

<p>The HTTP protocol also defines the no-cache directive for the Cache-Control header.

<p>Cache management is the responsibility of the client application or intermediate server, but if properly implemented it can save bandwidth and improve performance by removing the need to fetch data that has already been recently retrieved.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>max-age</em> value in the Cache-Control header is only a guide and not a guarantee that the corresponding data won&#8217;t change during the specified time.

<h2 id="_maintaining_responsiveness_scalability_and_availability">Maintaining responsiveness, scalability, and availability</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same web API might be used by many client applications running anywhere in the world. It is important to ensure that the web API is implemented to maintain responsiveness under a heavy load, to be scalable to support a highly varying workload, and to guarantee availability for clients that perform business-critical operations. Consider the following points when determining how to meet these requirements:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_provide_asynchronous_support_for_long_running_requests">Provide asynchronous support for long-running requests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A request that might take a long time to process should be performed without blocking the client that submitted the request. The web API can perform some initial checking to validate the request, initiate a separate task to perform the work, and then return a response message with HTTP code 202 (Accepted). The task could run asynchronously as part of the web API processing, or it could be offloaded to a background task.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The web API should also provide a mechanism to return the results of the processing to the client application. You can achieve this by providing a polling mechanism for client applications to periodically query whether the processing has finished and obtain the result, or enabling the web API to send a notification when the operation has completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can implement a simple polling mechanism by providing a polling URI that acts as a virtual resource using the following approach:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The client application sends the initial request to the web API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web API stores information about the request in a table held in table storage or Microsoft Azure Cache, and generates a unique key for this entry, possibly in the form of a GUID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web API initiates the processing as a separate task. The web API records the state of the task in the table as Running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web API returns a response message with HTTP status code 202 (Accepted), and the GUID of the table entry in the body of the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the task has completed, the web API stores the results in the table, and sets the state of the task to Complete. Note that if the task fails, the web API could also store information about the failure and set the status to Failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the task is running, the client can continue performing its own processing. It can periodically send a request to the URI <em>/polling/{guid}</em> where <em>{guid}</em> is the GUID returned in the 202 response message by the web API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web API at the <em>/polling/{guid}</em> URI queries the state of the corresponding task in the table and returns a response message with HTTP status code 200 (OK) containing this state (Running, Complete, or Failed). If the task has completed or failed, the response message can also include the results of the processing or any information available about the reason for the failure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Options for implementing notifications include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using a notification hub to push asynchronous responses to client applications. For more information, see Send notifications to specific users by using Azure Notification Hubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the Comet model to retain a persistent network connection between the client and the server hosting the web API, and using this connection to push messages from the server back to the client. The MSDN magazine article Building a Simple Comet Application in the Microsoft .NET Framework describes an example solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using SignalR to push data in real time from the web server to the client over a persistent network connection. SignalR is available for ASP.NET web applications as a NuGet package. You can find more information on the ASP.NET SignalR website.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ensure_that_each_request_is_stateless">Ensure that each request is stateless</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each request should be considered atomic. There should be no dependencies between one request made by a client application and any subsequent requests submitted by the same client. This approach assists in scalability; instances of the web service can be deployed on a number of servers. Client requests can be directed at any of these instances and the results should always be the same. It also improves availability for a similar reason; if a web server fails requests can be routed to another instance (by using Azure Traffic Manager) while the server is restarted with no ill effects on client applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_track_clients_and_implement_throttling_to_reduce_the_chances_of_dos_attacks">Track clients and implement throttling to reduce the chances of DOS attacks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a specific client makes a large number of requests within a given period of time it might monopolize the service and affect the performance of other clients. To mitigate this issue, a web API can monitor calls from client applications either by tracking the IP address of all incoming requests or by logging each authenticated access. You can use this information to limit resource access. If a client exceeds a defined limit, the web API can return a response message with status 503 (Service Unavailable) and include a Retry-After header that specifies when the client can send the next request without it being declined. This strategy can help to reduce the chances of a Denial Of Service (DOS) attack from a set of clients stalling the system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_manage_persistent_http_connections_carefully">Manage persistent HTTP connections carefully</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HTTP protocol supports persistent HTTP connections where they are available. The HTTP 1.0 specification added the Connection:Keep-Alive header that enables a client application to indicate to the server that it can use the same connection to send subsequent requests rather than opening new ones. The connection closes automatically if the client does not reuse the connection within a period defined by the host. This behavior is the default in HTTP 1.1 as used by Azure services, so there is no need to include Keep-Alive headers in messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keeping a connection open can help to improve responsiveness by reducing latency and network congestion, but it can be detrimental to scalability by keeping unnecessary connections open for longer than required, limiting the ability of other concurrent clients to connect. It can also affect battery life if the client application is running on a mobile device; if the application only makes occasional requests to the server, maintaining an open connection can cause the battery to drain more quickly. To ensure that a connection is not made persistent with HTTP 1.1, the client can include a Connection:Close header with messages to override the default behavior. Similarly, if a server is handling a very large number of clients it can include a Connection:Close header in response messages which should close the connection and save server resources.</p>

<p>Persistent HTTP connections are a purely optional feature to reduce the network overhead associated with repeatedly establishing a communications channel. Neither the web API nor the client application should depend on a persistent HTTP connection being available. Do not use persistent HTTP connections to implement Comet-style notification systems; instead you should use sockets (or web sockets if available) at the TCP layer. Finally, note Keep-Alive headers are of limited use if a client application communicates with a server via a proxy; only the connection with the client and the proxy will be persistent.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make a web API available for client applications, the web API must be deployed to a host environment. This environment is typically a web server, although it may be some other type of host process. You should consider the following points when publishing a web API:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All requests must be authenticated and authorized, and the appropriate level of access control must be enforced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commercial web API might be subject to various quality guarantees concerning response times. It is important to ensure that host environment is scalable if the load can vary significantly over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be necessary to meter requests for monetization purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be necessary to regulate the flow of traffic to the web API, and implement throttling for specific clients that have exhausted their quotas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory requirements might mandate logging and auditing of all requests and responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure availability, it may be necessary to monitor the health of the server hosting the web API and restart it if necessary.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have implemented your web API by using the ASP.NET Web API template (either as a Web API project or as a Web role in an Azure cloud service) and Visual Studio 2013, you can gather availability, performance, and usage data by using ASP.NET Application Insights. Application Insights is a package that transparently tracks and records information about requests and responses when the web API is deployed to the cloud; once the package is installed and configured, you don&#8217;t need to amend any code in your web API to use it. When you deploy the web API to an Azure web site, all traffic is examined and the following statistics are gathered:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server response time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of server requests and the details of each request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top slowest requests in terms of average response time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The details of any failed requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of sessions initiated by different browsers and user agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most frequently viewed pages (primarily useful for web applications rather than web APIs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The different user roles accessing the web API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can view this data in real time in the Azure portal. You can also create web tests that monitor the health of the web API. A web test sends a periodic request to a specified URI in the web API and captures the response. You can specify the definition of a successful response (such as HTTP status code 200), and if the request does not return this response you can arrange for an alert to be sent to an administrator. If necessary, the administrator can restart the server hosting the web API if it has failed.</p>

<h3 id="_monitoring_a_web_api_through_the_api_management_service">Monitoring a web API through the API Management Service</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have published your web API by using the API Management service, the API Management page on the Azure portal contains a dashboard that enables you to view the overall performance of the service. The Analytics page enables you to drill down into the details of how the product is being used. This page contains the following tabs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>. This tab provides information about the number of API calls made and the bandwidth used to handle these calls over time. You can filter usage details by product, API, and operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health</strong>. This tab enables you to view the outcome of API requests (the HTTP status codes returned), the effectiveness of the caching policy, the API response time, and the service response time. Again, you can filter health data by product, API, and operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Activity</strong>. This tab provides a text summary of the numbers of successful calls, failed calls, blocked calls, average response time, and response times for each product, web API, and operation. This page also lists the number of calls made by each developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>At a glance</strong>. This tab displays a summary of the performance data, including the developers responsible for making the most API calls, and the products, web APIs, and operations that received these calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use this information to determine whether a particular web API or operation is causing a bottleneck, and if necessary scale the host environment and add more servers. You can also ascertain whether one or more applications are using a disproportionate volume of resources and apply the appropriate policies to set quotas and limit call rates.</p>
