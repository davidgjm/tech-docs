<p>An important part of the monitoring and diagnostics process is analyzing the gathered data to obtain a picture of the overall well-being of the system. You should have defined your own KPIs and performance metrics, and it&#8217;s important to understand how you can structure the data that has been gathered to meet your analysis requirements. It&#8217;s also important to understand how the data that&#8217;s captured in different metrics and log files is correlated, because this information can be key to tracking a sequence of events and help diagnose problems that arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described in the section <a href="collecting-and-storing.html#_consolidating_instrumentation_data">Consolidating instrumentation data</a>, the data for each part of the system is typically captured locally, but it generally needs to be combined with data generated at other sites that participate in the system. This information requires careful correlation to ensure that data is combined accurately. For example, the usage data for an operation might span a node that hosts a website to which a user connects, a node that runs a separate service accessed as part of this operation, and data storage held on another node. This information needs to be tied together to provide an overall view of the resource and processing usage for the operation. Some preprocessing and filtering of data might occur on the node on which the data is captured, whereas aggregation and formatting are more likely to occur on a central node.</p>

<h3 id="_hot_analysis">hot analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analyzing and reformatting data for visualization, reporting, and alerting purposes can be a complex process that consumes its own set of resources. Some forms of monitoring are time-critical and require immediate analysis of data to be effective. This is known as <em>hot analysis</em>. Examples include the analysis that are required for alerting and some aspects of security monitoring (such as detecting an attack on the system). Data that&#8217;s required for these purposes must be quickly available and structured for efficient processing. In some cases, it might be necessary to move the analysis processing to the individual nodes where the data is held.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_warm_analysis">warm analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other forms of analysis are less time-critical and might require some computation and aggregation after the raw data has been received.This is called <em>warm analysis</em>.Performance analysis often falls into this category.In this case, an isolated, single performance event is unlikely to be statistically significant.(It might be caused by a sudden spike or glitch.) The data from a series of events should provide a more reliable picture of system performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Warm analysis can also be used to help diagnose health issues.A health event is typically processed through hot analysis and can raise an alert immediately.An operator should be able to drill into the reasons for the health event by examining the data from the warm path.This data should contain information about the events leading up to the issue that caused the health event.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cold_analysis">cold analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some types of monitoring generate more long-term data.This analysis can be performed at a later date, possibly according to a predefined schedule.In some cases, the analysis might need to perform complex filtering of large volumes of data captured over a period of time.This is called <em>cold analysis</em>.The key requirement is that the data is stored safely after it has been captured.For example, usage monitoring and auditing require an accurate picture of the state of the system at regular points in time, but this state information does not have to be available for processing immediately after it has been gathered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An operator can also use cold analysis to provide the data for predictive health analysis.The operator can gather historical information over a specified period and use it in conjunction with the current health data (retrieved from the hot path) to spot trends that might soon cause health issues.In these cases, it might be necessary to raise an alert so that corrective action can be taken.</p>

<h2 id="_correlating_data">Correlating data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data that instrumentation captures can provide a snapshot of the system state, but the purpose of analysis is to make this data actionable.For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What has caused an intense I/O loading at the system level at a specific time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it the result of a large number of database operations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this reflected in the database response times, the number of transactions per second, and application response times at the same juncture?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If so, one remedial action that might reduce the load might be to shard the data over more servers.In addition, exceptions can arise as a result of a fault in any level of the system.An exception in one level often triggers another fault in the level above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, you need to be able to correlate the different types of monitoring data at each level to produce an overall view of the state of the system and the applications that are running on it.You can then use this information to make decisions about whether the system is functioning acceptably or not, and determine what can be done to improve the quality of the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described in the section <a href="instrumenting-application.html#_information_for_correlating_data">Information for correlating data</a>, you must ensure that the raw instrumentation data includes sufficient context and activity ID information to support the required aggregations for correlating events. Additionally, this data might be held in different formats, and it might be necessary to parse this information to convert it into a standardized format for analysis.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_troubleshooting_and_diagnosing_issues">Troubleshooting and diagnosing issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Diagnosis requires the ability to determine the cause of faults or unexpected behavior, including performing root cause analysis. The information that&#8217;s required typically includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detailed information from event logs and traces, either for the entire system or for a specified subsystem during a specified time window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete stack traces resulting from exceptions and faults of any specified level that occur within the system or a specified subsystem during a specified period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crash dumps for any failed processes either anywhere in the system or for a specified subsystem during a specified time window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity logs recording the operations that are performed either by all users or for selected users during a specified period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analyzing data for troubleshooting purposes often requires a deep technical understanding of the system architecture and the various components that compose the solution. As a result, a large degree of manual intervention is often required to interpret the data, establish the cause of problems, and recommend an appropriate strategy to correct them. It might be appropriate simply to store a copy of this information in its original format and make it available for cold analysis by an expert.</p>
