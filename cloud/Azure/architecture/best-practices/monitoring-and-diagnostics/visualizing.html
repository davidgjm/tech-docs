<p>The most common way to visualize data is to use dashboards that can display information as a series of charts, graphs, or some other illustration. These items can be parameterized, and an analyst should be able to select the important parameters (such as the time period) for any specific situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dashboards can be organized hierarchically. Top-level dashboards can give an overall view of each aspect of the system but enable an operator to drill down to the details. For example, a dashboard that depicts the overall disk I/O for the system should allow an analyst to view the I/O rates for each individual disk to ascertain whether one or more specific devices account for a disproportionate volume of traffic. Ideally, the dashboard should also display related information, such as the source of each request (the user or activity) that&#8217;s generating this I/O. This information can then be used to determine whether (and how) to spread the load more evenly across devices, and whether the system would perform better if more devices were added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A dashboard might also use color-coding or some other visual cues to indicate values that appear anomalous or that are outside an expected range. Using the previous example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A disk with an I/O rate that&#8217;s approaching its maximum capacity over an extended period (a hot disk) can be highlighted in red.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disk with an I/O rate that periodically runs at its maximum limit over short periods (a warm disk) can be highlighted in yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disk that&#8217;s exhibiting normal usage can be displayed in green.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that for a dashboard system to work effectively, it must have the raw data to work with. If you are building your own dashboard system, or using a dashboard developed by another organization, you must understand which instrumentation data you need to collect, at what levels of granularity, and how it should be formatted for the dashboard to consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good dashboard does not only display information, it also enables an analyst to pose ad hoc questions about that information. Some systems provide management tools that an operator can use to perform these tasks and explore the underlying data. Alternatively, depending on the repository that&#8217;s used to hold this information, it might be possible to query this data directly, or import it into tools such as Microsoft Excel for further analysis and reporting.</p>

You should restrict access to dashboards to authorized personnel, because this information might be commercially sensitive. You should also protect the underlying data for dashboards to prevent users from changing it.

<h2 id="_raising_alerts">Raising alerts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alerting is the process of analyzing the monitoring and instrumentation data and generating a notification if a significant event is detected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alerting helps ensure that the system remains healthy, responsive, and secure. It&#8217;s an important part of any system that makes performance, availability, and privacy guarantees to the users where the data might need to be acted on immediately. An operator might need to be notified of the event that triggered the alert. Alerting can also be used to invoke system functions such as autoscaling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alerting usually depends on the following instrumentation data:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Security events.</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the event logs indicate that repeated authentication and/or authorization failures are occurring, the system might be under attack and an operator should be informed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Performance metrics.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The system must quickly respond if a particular performance metric exceeds a specified threshold.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Availability information.</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a fault is detected, it might be necessary to quickly restart one or more subsystems, or fail over to a backup resource. Repeated faults in a subsystem might indicate more serious concerns.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operators might receive alert information by using many delivery channels such as email, a pager device, or an SMS text message. An alert might also include an indication of how critical a situation is. Many alerting systems support subscriber groups, and all operators who are members of the same group can receive the same set of alerts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alerting system should be customizable, and the appropriate values from the underlying instrumentation data can be provided as parameters. This approach enables an operator to filter data and focus on those thresholds or combinations of values that are of interest. Note that in some cases, the raw instrumentation data can be provided to the alerting system. In other situations, it might be more appropriate to supply aggregated data. (For example, an alert can be triggered if the CPU utilization for a node has exceeded 90 percent over the last 10 minutes). The details provided to the alerting system should also include any appropriate summary and context information. This data can help reduce the possibility that false-positive events will trip an alert.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reporting">Reporting</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reporting is used to generate an overall view of the system. It might incorporate historical data in addition to current information. Reporting requirements themselves fall into two broad categories: operational reporting and security reporting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operational reporting typically includes the following aspects:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aggregating statistics that you can use to understand resource utilization of the overall system or specified subsystems during a specified time window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying trends in resource usage for the overall system or specified subsystems during a specified period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring the exceptions that have occurred throughout the system or in specified subsystems during a specified period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining the efficiency of the application in terms of the deployed resources, and understanding whether the volume of resources (and their associated cost) can be reduced without affecting performance unnecessarily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Security reporting is concerned with tracking customers' use of the system. It can include:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Auditing user operations.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This requires recording the individual requests that each user performs, together with dates and times. The data should be structured to enable an administrator to quickly reconstruct the sequence of operations that a user performs over a specified period.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tracking resource use by user.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This requires recording how each request for a user accesses the various resources that compose the system, and for how long. An administrator must be able to use this data to generate a utilization report by user over a specified period, possibly for billing purposes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many cases, batch processes can generate reports according to a defined schedule. (Latency is not normally an issue.) But they should also be available for generation on an ad hoc basis if needed. As an example, if you are storing data in a relational database such as Azure SQL Database, you can use a tool such as SQL Server Reporting Services to extract and format data and present it as a set of reports.</p>
