= Security
Gone are the days when security focused solely on a strong perimeter defense to keep out malicious hackers. Anything outside the perimeter was treated as hostile, whereas inside the wall, an organization's systems were trusted. Today's security posture is to assume breach and use the *Zero Trust* model.

Security professionals no longer focus on perimeter defense. Modern organizations have to support access to data and services evenly from both inside and outside the corporate firewall.
