= Security
Gone are the days when security focused solely on a strong perimeter defense to keep out malicious hackers. Anything outside the perimeter was treated as hostile, whereas inside the wall, an organization's systems were trusted. Today's security posture is to assume breach and use the *Zero Trust* model.

Security professionals no longer focus on perimeter defense. Modern organizations have to support access to data and services evenly from both inside and outside the corporate firewall.

== Defense in depth
=== Zero Trust model
The analyst firm Forrester Research introduced the Zero Trust model, which states that you should never assume trust but instead continually validate trust. When users, devices, and data all resided inside the organization's firewall, they were assumed to be trusted. This assumed trust allowed for easy lateral movement after a malicious hacker compromised an endpoint device.

=== Defense in depth: A layered approach to security
_Defense in depth_ is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack that's aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to information. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure.

The common principles that help define a security posture are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, known collectively as CIA.

* **Confidentiality**: The principle of least privilege restricts access to information only to individuals explicitly granted access. This information includes protection of user passwords, remote access certificates, and email content.

* **Integrity**: The goal is to prevent unauthorized changes to information at rest or in transit. A common approach used in data transmission is for the sender to create a unique fingerprint of the data by using a one-way hashing algorithm. The hash is sent to the receiver along with the data. The receiver recalculates the data's hash and compares it to the original to ensure that the data wasn't lost or modified in transit.

* **Availability**: Ensure that services are available to authorized users. Denial-of-service attacks are a common cause of loss of availability to users. Natural disasters also drive system design to prevent single points of failure and deploy multiple instances of an application to geo-dispersed locations.

=== Security layers
You can visualize defense in depth as a set of concentric rings, with the data to be secured at the center. Each ring adds a layer of security around the data. This approach removes reliance on any single layer of protection. It also acts to slow down an attack and provide alert telemetry that can be acted upon, either automatically or manually.

Each layer can implement one or more of the CIA concerns:

==== Data
In almost all cases, attackers are after data:

* Stored in a database.
* Stored on disk inside virtual machines.
* Stored on a software as a service (SaaS) application such as Microsoft 365.
* Stored in cloud storage.

==== Applications

* Ensure that applications are secure and free of vulnerabilities.
* Store sensitive application secrets in a secure storage medium.
* Make security a design requirement for all application development.

Integrating security into the application development life cycle will help reduce the number of vulnerabilities introduced in code. Encourage all development teams to make their applications secure by default. Make security requirements non-negotiable.

==== Compute

* Secure access to virtual machines.
* Implement endpoint protection and keep systems patched and current.

Malware, unpatched systems, and improperly secured systems open your environment to attacks. The focus in this layer is on making sure that your compute resources are secure, and that you have the proper controls in place to minimize security issues.

==== Networking

* Limit communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
* Deny by default.
* Restrict inbound internet access and limit outbound where appropriate.
* Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks.

At this layer, the focus is on limiting network connectivity across all your resources. Segment your resources and use network-level controls to restrict communication to only what's needed. By limiting this communication, you reduce the risk of lateral movement throughout your network.

==== Perimeter
* Use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
* Use perimeter firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks against your network.

At the network perimeter, it's about protecting from network-based attacks against your resources. Identifying these attacks, eliminating their impact, and alerting on them are important to keep your network secure.

==== Identity and access

* Control access to infrastructure (change control).
* Use single sign-on and multifactor authentication.
* Audit events and changes.

The identity and access layer is all about ensuring that identities are secure, access granted is only what's needed, and changes are logged.

==== Physical security
Physical building security and controlling access to computing hardware within the datacenter are the first line of defense.

With physical security, the intent is to provide physical safeguards against access to assets. This ensures that other layers can't be bypassed, and that loss or theft is handled appropriately.

=== Continuous improvement
The threat landscape is evolving in real time and at massive scale, so a security architecture is never complete. Microsoft and its customers need the ability to respond to these threats intelligently, quickly, and at scale.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides customers with unified security management and advanced threat protection to understand and respond to security events on-premises and in Azure. In turn, Azure customers have a responsibility to continually reevaluate and evolve their security architecture.
