<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cost optimization is ensuring that the money your organization spends is being used to maximum effect. Cloud services provide computing as a utility. Technologies in the cloud are provided under a service model, to be consumed on demand. This on-demand service offering drives a fundamental change that directly affects planning, bookkeeping, and organizing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_plan_and_estimate_costs">Plan and estimate costs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This estimate involves identifying any current resources to move or redevelop, understanding business objectives that might affect sizing, and selecting the appropriate services for the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the requirements identified, you can use cost estimation tools to provide a more concise estimate of the resources that would be required. Transparency is important here, so that all stakeholders can review for accuracy and have visibility into the costs that are associated with the project.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_provision_with_optimization">Provision with optimization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where possible, you want to move from IaaS to PaaS services. PaaS services typically cost less than IaaS, and they typically reduce your operational costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With PaaS services, you don&#8217;t have to worry about patching or maintaining VMs, because the cloud provider typically handles those activities. Not all applications can be moved to PaaS, but with the cost savings that PaaS services provide, it&#8217;s worth considering.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_monitoring_and_analytics_to_gain_cost_insights">Use monitoring and analytics to gain cost insights</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re not monitoring your spending, you don&#8217;t know what you can save. Take advantage of cost management tools and regularly review billing statements to better understand where money is being spent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take time to conduct regular cost reviews across services to understand if the expenditure is appropriate for the resource requirements of the workload. Adjust expenditures as necessary. Identify and track down any cost anomalies that might show up on billing statements or through alerts. If you notice a large spike in cost associated with network traffic, it might uncover both cost savings and potential technical issues.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_maximize_efficiency_of_cloud_spend">Maximize efficiency of cloud spend</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Efficiency is focused on identifying and eliminating unnecessary expenses within your environment. The cloud is a pay-as-you-go service, and avoidable expenses are typically the result of provisioning more capacity than your demand requires. Operational costs can also contribute to unnecessary or inefficient costs. These inefficient operational costs show up as wasted time and increased error. As you design your architecture, identify and eliminate waste across your environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a few examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A virtual machine that&#8217;s always 90 percent idle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paying for a license included in a virtual machine when a license is already owned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retaining infrequently accessed data on a storage medium optimized for frequent access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually repeating the build of a non-production environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you evaluate your cost, take the opportunity to optimize environments. Capacity demands can and will change over time, and many cloud services can manually or dynamically adjust the provisioned resources to meet the demands. These adjustments can drive the balance between a well-running application and the most cost-effective size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Optimize your systems at every level. At the network level, ensure that data transfer is efficient and meets the expectations of your customers. Use services to cache data to increase application performance and reduce the transaction load on your data storage services. Identify and decommission unused resources. Take advantage of lower-cost data storage tiers to archive infrequently accessed data.</p>
