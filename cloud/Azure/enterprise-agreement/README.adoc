Enterprise Agreement enrollment represents the commercial relationship between Microsoft and how your organization uses Azure. It provides billing foundation for your subscriptions and how your digital estate is administered.

An enrollment often represents an organization's hierarchy, including *departments*, *accounts*, and subscriptions. This hierarchy represents cost centers within an organization.

== Enterprise Agreement Enrollment Hierarchy
Departments:: help you segment costs into logical groupings. Departments enable you to set a budget or quota at the department level.

Accounts:: are organizational units in the Azure Enterprise portal. You can use accounts to manage subscriptions and access reports.

Subscriptions:: are the smallest unit in the Azure Enterprise portal. They're containers for Azure services managed by the service administrator.

Roles work in two different portals to complete tasks. You use the _Azure Enterprise portal_ to manage billing and costs, and the _Azure portal_ to manage Azure services.

Direct EA customers can complete all administrative tasks in the Azure portal. You can use the Azure Portal to manage billing, costs, and Azure services.

User roles are associated with a user account. To validate user authenticity, each user must have a valid work, school, or Microsoft account. Ensure that each account is associated with an email address that's actively monitored. Account notifications are sent to the email address.

When setting up users, you can assign multiple accounts to the enterprise administrator role. However, only one account can hold the account owner role. Also, you can assign both the enterprise administrator and account owner roles to a single account.
