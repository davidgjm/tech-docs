== Decision dimensions

Internet facing:: Applications that are publicly accessible from the internet.
Global:: End users or clients are located beyond a small geographical area
HTTP/HTTPS:: HTTP(S) load-balancing services are Layer 7 load balancers that only accept HTTP(S) traffic. They are intended for web applications or other HTTP(S) endpoints. They include features such as SSL offload, web application firewall, path-based load balancing, and session affinity. *Non-HTTP/S* load-balancing services can handle non-HTTP(S) traffic and are recommended for non-web workloads.
SSL offloading:: whether the load balancing service offloads CPU intensive SSL termination so that the backend services don't have to work on SSL encryption/decryption.
