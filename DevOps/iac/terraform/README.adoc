=== https://www.terraform.io/cli/state/resource-addressing[Resource Addressing]
A _resource address_ is a string that identifies zero or more resource instances in your overall configuration.

An address is made up of two parts:
[source]
----
[module path][resource spec]
----

==== Resource spec
A resource spec addresses a specific resource instance in the selected module. It has the following syntax:
[source]
----
resource_type.resource_name[instance index]
----
- `resource_type` - Type of the resource being addressed.
- `resource_name` - User-defined name of the resource.
- `[instance index]` - (Optional) Index to select an instance from a resource that has multiple instances, surrounded by square bracket characters (`[` and `]`).
